## Kost

***Kost*** *(Danish for 'diet')* is a Django powered food journal application with an advanced ratings system that automatically tracks meals/ingredients' ratings over time, and eventually give ratings for prospective meals based on ingredients and prep methods!

I suffer from a severe case of Gastroparesis which required me to put my diet under a magnifying glass. I had to track what I ate, how much of it I ate, and how well is sat with me. After a while, my little food journal I was writing in became unwieldy..
 - Items were getting duplicate entries due to human error
 - Any and all meaningful long term observations were lost in the mix
 - Impossible to track down entries in a reasonable amount of time

As said by a million people a million different times... there had to be a better way...

Thus, Kost was born.. Powered by Python via the Django Framework

***NOT YET FUNCTIONAL***
