***Kost*** *(Danish for 'diet')* is a Django powered food journal application with an advanced ratings system that automatically tracks meals/ingredients' ratings over time, and eventually give ratings for prospective meals based on ingredients and prep methods!

-   Simple
-   Straight-forward
-   Customizable

I suffer from a severe case of Gastroparesis which required me to put my diet under a magnifying glass. I had to track what I ate, how much of it I ate, and how well it sat with me. After a while, my little food journal I was writing in became unwieldy..
-   Items were getting duplicate entries due to human error (instead, track trend of a given ingredient/meal)
-   Any and all meaningful long term observations were lost in the mix
-   Impossible to track down entries in a reasonable amount of time

Kost is being developed to resolve these issues and allow a simpler user experience.
